This is an accessory client for the CrowdTraQ application. Because its main functionality is an a dynamic and informational display, this client can remain lightweight and is compatible accross multiple browsers.  The UI was designed to be displayed in a central location so that users can observe information about the currently playing song (song title, artist, album cover), as well as information about the queue length and cost to add a song to the queue.
